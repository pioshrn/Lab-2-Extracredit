#Problem Description
The task is to break Caesar's cipher using frequency analysis. Caesar's cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Frequency analysis exploits the fact that certain letters occur more frequently in a language than others.

Approach
Frequency Analysis: Analyze the frequency of letters in the encrypted text to identify the most common letters.
Character Shift: Use the known frequency distribution of letters in the English language to guess the shift value used in the Caesar cipher.
Brute Force: Try all possible shift values (typically 1-25) and compute the frequency distribution for each decryption attempt. The decrypted text with a frequency distribution closest to the expected distribution for English text is considered the correct decryption.
Instructions
Input: Provide the encrypted text to be decrypted.
Output: The most likely decryption of the text.
Execution:
Run the program/script.
Enter the encrypted text when prompted.
The program will output the decrypted text using frequency analysis.
Usage
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Run the provided Python script using python caesar_cipher_decryption.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the encrypted text.
The script will output the decrypted text.
